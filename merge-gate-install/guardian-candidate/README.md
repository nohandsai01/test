# Guardian evidence adapter — source-only candidate

**SOURCE_ONLY / FEATURE_OFF / LAUNCH_HOLD.** This isolated component is stacked
after Draft PR #2. It does not install a GitHub workflow/App, issue a check,
change branch rules, merge, deploy, or handle payments.

`evidence-snapshot.cjs` exports `inspectEvidenceSnapshot(rawPolicy, rawSnapshot)`.
Inputs must be raw JSON bytes or strings; duplicate keys and oversized input
fail closed. The function checks a prospective `nohandsai01/test` PR to `main`
at an exact pinned SHA, and checks two distinct internal evidence types:
`tests` and `ci`. Each must match one declared check name, approved issuer App
ID, the PR SHA, completed status, and successful conclusion. Missing, duplicate
or incomplete check-run lists are rejected.

## Contract for the later external collector

Candidate `rawPolicy` shape (values are placeholders, **not** approved IDs):

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "repository": "nohandsai01/test",
  "targetBranch": "main",
  "headSha": "<40 lowercase hexadecimal characters>",
  "evidence": [
    {"type":"tests", "checkName":"<approved name>", "issuerAppId":0},
    {"type":"ci", "checkName":"<approved name>", "issuerAppId":0}
  ]
}
```

IDs of `0` intentionally **cannot** pass. A separately governed Guardian
service must provide actual independently approved IDs, not accept values from
a PR author. A `rawSnapshot` is a normalized subset of GitHub's pull-request
and check-runs REST responses, with exact top-level keys `repository`,
`pullRequest`, `checkRuns`:

```json
{
  "repository":"nohandsai01/test",
  "pullRequest":{
    "number":2,
    "state":"open",
    "base":{"ref":"main","repo":{"full_name":"nohandsai01/test"}},
    "head":{"sha":"<exact head SHA>","repo":{"full_name":"nohandsai01/test"}}
  },
  "checkRuns":{"total_count":0,"check_runs":[]}
}
```

This illustrates a *future direct PR to main*. Draft PR #2 is actually stacked
against the post-QA feature branch and is not claimed eligible.

## Next source-only development batch: authenticated reader + signed policy

The following three modules are stacked after the original evidence snapshot
adapter. They are **not** a production Guardian installation:

- `signed-policy.cjs` verifies an Ed25519 signature over raw policy bytes. The
  envelope has exactly `schemaVersion`, `algorithm`, `payloadBase64`, and
  `signatureBase64`. The signed payload has `schemaVersion`, `issuedAt`,
  `expiresAt`, and `evidencePolicy` (the exact policy shape above). Signatures
  must be canonical base64 and the signed approval must expire within 24 hours.
  The public key is injected by a separate trusted runtime, never read from
  this repository or the incoming PR.
- `github-rest-collector.cjs` uses **HTTPS GET only** to fixed
  `api.github.com` REST endpoints with a GitHub App **installation access
  token** supplied by the host. It checks installation repository scope,
  fetches the PR twice, fetches the check-suite count to reject GitHub's
  1000-suite truncation boundary, enumerates every page of check runs with
  `filter=all`, rejects missing/duplicate records, and re-reads the first check
  page to detect some concurrent changes. There is no anonymous/PAT fallback,
  arbitrary URL, redirect follow, mutation, or token logging. This is **not an
  atomic snapshot** and does not establish last-push or reviewer provenance.
- `read-and-evaluate.cjs` verifies the signed policy first, then makes the
  authenticated REST reads, and only then calls `inspectEvidenceSnapshot`.
  Its output **always remains `SOURCE_ONLY_HOLD`, `trusted:false`,
  `activationAllowed:false`, and `authoritativeRequiredCheck:NOT_ISSUED`**.

### Runtime boundary

The host integration must supply these fields, outside PR-controlled content:

```js
const { readAndEvaluateGuardianCandidate } = require('./read-and-evaluate.cjs');

const result = await readAndEvaluateGuardianCandidate({
  pullNumber: approvedPullNumber,
  signedPolicyEnvelope: independentlyIssuedEnvelopeBytes,
  trustedPolicyPublicKeyPem: protectedHostTrustAnchor,
  githubAppInstallationToken: hostMintedReadOnlyInstallationToken,
});
// result.trusted === false; result.activationAllowed === false
```

This snippet defines a future host contract, **not** an executable runbook.
No private key, token, key material, or approved App ID is included here.
The source cannot attest that the host's public key is independently managed,
that an installation token came from the intended App, or that the target's
branch protection is configured. Those are external activation gates.

The collector uses the documented `GET /installation/repositories`,
`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}`,
`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{ref}/check-suites`, and
`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{ref}/check-runs` endpoints. The latter
uses `filter=all`, not the default `latest`. The code rejects counts beyond
its bounded collection capacity, rather than treating a partial result as
complete. It uses the pinned REST API version `2022-11-28`.

## Non-negotiable missing authority

Even when every field matches, output remains `trusted=false`,
`activationAllowed=false`, `hostedCheckEvidence=NOT_VERIFIED` and
`authoritativeRequiredCheck=NOT_ISSUED`. The only possible positive source
label is `SNAPSHOT_SHAPE_MATCH_ONLY`, not `PASS`.

Before any active GitHub App integration, separately prove:

1. Independent immutable policy source and authenticated App installation;
2. fresh direct GitHub API reads, complete pagination, and exact-head re-read;
3. check-run origin, workflow/run association, last-push and review provenance
   (matching only the App ID is insufficient);
4. protected-branch ruleset binding the single
   `NO HANDS Merge Gate Required Check` to the expected dedicated Guardian App;
5. separate Founder authorization to install, activate, merge, or deploy.

The `success` check here is deliberately stricter than GitHub's general
required-status-check acceptance of neutral/skipped outcomes.
